        <p >Pride and Prejudice is an 1813 novel of manners by English author Jane Austen. The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the book, who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness.

            Mr Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the daughters marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot.</p>

The story is narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old girl with thyroid cancer that has affected her lungs. Hazel is forced by her parents to attend a support group where she subsequently meets and falls in love with 17-year-old Augustus Waters, an ex-basketball player, amputee, and survivor of osteosarcoma.

        <p>Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about the romance between two Italian youths from feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.

            Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. The plot is based on an Italian tale written by Matteo Bandello and translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality, however, and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare's original.
            
            Shakespeare's use of poetic dramatic structure (including effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, the expansion of minor characters, and numerous sub-plots to embellish the story) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play.
            
            Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical, and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda's Romeo und Julie omitted much of the action and used a happy ending.</p>

            College graduate Lily Bloom moves to Boston with hopes of opening her own floral shop. She has recently given the eulogy at her father's funeral, in her hometown of Plethora, Maine. Her father was abusive towards her mother, who kept the abuse a secret, leading Lily to resent both of them. She reads through her old childhood diaries and remembers her first love Atlas Corrigan, who left to join the military, but promised to return to her.
            
            While wrestling with her feelings, she meets neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid. They are mutually attracted to one another, but do not pursue a relationship as Lily is looking for commitment while Ryle is only interested in a casual fling. However, once Lily successfully starts her business, they continue to meet, and start a relationship.
            
            One night, Lily laughs when Ryle accidentally drops a casserole, and he angrily pushes her to the ground before frantically apologizing. Lily is reminded of her father's treatment of her mother; while horrified, she decides they are different from her parents and accepts his apologies, but warns him that she will leave if he hurts her again.
            
            While dining at a restaurant where Atlas works, Lily reconnects with him, making Ryle instantly jealous despite her insistence that Atlas is only a friend. Suspecting that Ryle may be abusing Lily after noticing her injuries, Atlas secretly gives her his phone number..</p>
